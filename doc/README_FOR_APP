ONLINE MEDIA MANAGER

Online Media Manager is an open-source Ruby on Rails online media management system,
developed as part of the MSc in Information Technology degree programme at the
University of Aberdeen (http://www.abdn.ac.uk/).  The project client is the charity
Survival International (http://www.survival-international.org), who safeguard the
rights of indigenous tribes people throughout the world.  Survival International
required an application to organise and upload images and allow them to be assigned to
selected users.  The user with authorisation to view these image thumbnails can then
download the high resolution version of the image.

The Online Media Manager is a fully open-source application that provides a free
solution for a commercial-style image management system.
